TARGET, a simple line based web game


Currently needs a bit of a refactor, MVC was a bit neglected towards the end of the project, sacrificed for adding features for easy marks (past assignment).

Will be sorted soon as other assignments out the way.

A live demo can be found on my university filespace (temporary, though not sure if my web hosting could cope if it does go anywhere) - users.aber.ac.uk/gij2/iwp

Suggestions of further features can be found in the last section of writeup.pdf.
