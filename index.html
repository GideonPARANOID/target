			<h2>
				ABOUT THE GAME
			</h2>
			<p>
				The game is a fast paced, bright & energetic action game. TARGET has a large number of increasingly difficult levels & there is a range of differently levelled achievements & it stores the user's high scores to encourage competition. It uses both the mouse & the keyboard for playing (though the latter mainly for menus). 
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				HOW TO PLAY
			</h2>
			<p class='no-end'>
				You can find out how to play by pressing 'h' on the main menu. The idea of the game is stop incoming lines (threats) from reaching the <i>TARGET</i>. This is done by drawing your own lines (defenses) using the mouse - pressing the mouse button to start drawing a line, dragging and releasing to end & draw the line. The controls for each menu are detailed at the bottom of each screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the levels change, the size of the <i>TARGET</i> changes & the rate at which new threats come in increases, as well as the speed of each threat. The game does has a difficulty spike after the twelfth level, but this is to make the achievement for getting to the fifteenth level more valuable. Implemented achievements are <i>SURVIVOR</i> for surviving a certain number of levels without losing a life and <i>COMPLETIONIST</i> for generally completing levels. There are different levels of each for each three levels.
			</p>
			<h2>
				DESIGN OVERVIEW
			</h2>
			<p>
				The game is written in a manner inspired by the Model View Controller design pattern, though it doesn't follow it to a key. This inspired the filenames of the JavaScript files & and the function names. The game uses an awful lot of loops (setInterval) for menus, animation and game mechanics in general, but maintains performance - critical in a fast paced game - by stopping each as soon as they're no longer needed.
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				SOUND
			</h2>
			<p class='no-end'>
				The game uses open license music taken from <a href='http://freemusicarchive.org/'>Free Music Archive</a>. The game gives the user the option to mute music by pressing 'm' at any time, it might get repetitive the track listing is only four long:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Moves</i> by Sycamore Drive</li>
				<li><i>Happiness</i> by Sycamore Drive</li>
				<li><i>Computer Truck</i> by Euritmix Sux My Dix</li>
				<li><i>Shiny spaceship</i> by 8-Bit Ninjas</li>
			</ul>	
			<p>
				The game also makes use of sound effects, also with an open license, taken from <a href='http://www.freesound.org/'>Freesound</a>. These are used for <a href='http://www.freesound.org/people/xitherun/sounds/105020/'>destroying threats</a>, <a href='http://www.freesound.org/people/iut_Paris8/sounds/110569/'>levelling up</a>, <a href='http://freesound.org/people/soundnimja/sounds/173326/'>losing a life</a> & <a href='http://www.freesound.org/people/fins/sounds/133283/'>game over</a>. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				EXTERNAL SOURCES
			</h2>
			<p class='no-end'>
				In terms of libraries, the game makes use of <a href='http://jquery.com/'>jQuery</a> & <a href='http://craig.is/killing/mice'>Mousetrap</a>. Both are linked from CDNs as these are likely to already be in the browser's cache (faster than hosting myself).
			</p>
			<p class='no-end'>
				The game also uses the API of the <a href='http://www.colourlovers.com/'>Colourlovers</a> to get colour palettes to generate the styles for each level. This has its pros & cons - it means lots of possible nicely colour co-ordinated levels, but it can end up with very difficult levels due to contrast. It also is another dependency on another website & due to its asnychronous nature (limited by the fact it's cross-domain JSONP), it can make the game break if the player starts the game before it finishes loading.
